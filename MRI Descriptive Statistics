WMH volumes were normalized by total intracranial volume to account for differences in head sizes and cube-root transformed, in that order. Non-normalized WMH volumes also underwent cube-root transformation for sensitivity analysis.

df$v1.wmhv.tot.adj <- (df$v1.wmhv.tot / df$v1.tiv)*100
df$v1.wmhv.tot.adj.cube <- sign(df$v1.wmhv.tot.adj) * abs(df$v1.wmhv.tot.adj)^(1/3)

Our sample had an average WMH volume of 2.26  2.77ml (n=643; median = 1.39 ml).

	# Number of participants with WMHV data
sum(!is.na(df$v1.wmhv.tot), na.rm=T)

# Mean and SD
mean(df$v1.wmhv.tot, na.rm=T)
sd(df$v1.wmhv.tot, na.rm=T)

# Median
median(df$v1.wmhv.tot, na.rm=T)


A small proportion (6.2%; n=40 out of 647) had a high burden of WMH.

	# Definition of “high” WMH burden, based on Fazekas rating
df$wmh.high <- ifelse(df$v1.pvh==3, 1,
                        ifelse(df$v1.dwmh>=2,1,0))

# Computation of % with high WMH burden
n <- sum(!is.na(df$wmh.high), na.rm=T)
sum(df$wmh.high=="1", na.rm=T)/n 


WMH burden increased with older age in both the unadjusted (t = 8.15, p < 0.001) and adjusted analysis controlling for sex, education, and site (t = 7.91, p < 0.001). 

	# Unadjusted for covariates
cor.test(df$v1.wmhv.tot.adj.cube, df$age)

# Adjusted for covariates
summary(lm(v1.wmhv.tot.adj.cube ~ sex + age.c + edu.c + site, data = df))


Males (2.99 ml) had greater WMH volumes than females (1.81 ml), even after normalising for head size [(WMH volume/intracranial volume)*100%; males = 0.16, females = 0.11] – results were significant in both unadjusted (rho = 0.25, p < .001) and covariate-adjusted analyses of WMH burden (t = 5.41, p < .001). 

# Mean volumes (unadjusted for head size)
mean(subset(df, sex=="Male")$v1.wmhv.tot, na.rm=T)
mean(subset(df, sex=="Female")$v1.wmhv.tot, na.rm=T)

# Mean volumes (adjusted for head size)
mean(subset(df, sex=="Male")$v1.wmhv.tot.adj, na.rm=T)
mean(subset(df, sex=="Female")$v1.wmhv.tot.adj, na.rm=T)

	# Testing of group differences, unadjusted for covariates
cor.test(df$v1.wmhv.tot.adj.cube, df$sex.male.numeric, method='spearman')

# Testing of group differences, adjusted for covariates
summary(m <- lm(v1.wmhv.tot.adj.cube ~ sex + age.c + edu.c + site, data = df))
